# Pitcher-experiment

# Contains data and code used in the manuscript: "Symbiont virulence is a poor predictor of impacts on host population dynamics"

# METADATA for Individual reprod and Individual mort:
# parasite: C - control - unexposed Daphnia
# parasite: MG - Daphnia exposed to Ordospora pajunii
# parasite: MET - Daphnia exposed to Metschnikowia bicuspidata
# rep - replicate number
# lifespan - number of days given Daphnia lived
# status - determines if data was censored (0 - event i.e. death did not occur) or not (1 - event occured, i.e. Daphnia died)

# METADATA for Population data:
# treatment: C - control - unexposed Daphnia
# treatment: OP - Daphnia exposed to Ordospora pajunii
# treatment: MB - Daphnia exposed to Metschnikowia bicuspidata
# treatment: OPMB - Daphnia exposed to Ordospora pajunii and to Metschnikowia bicuspidata
# rep - replicate number
# date - date of screening
# day - number of days since the beginning of the experiment
# total volume ml - volume of the pitcher (experimental unit)
# subsample volume ml - volume of the collected subsample for which the Daphnia counts were made
# UA - number of uninfected adults in the subsample
# UJ - number of uninfected juveniles in the subsample
# UM - number of uninfected males in the subsample
# OPA - number of adults infected with O. pajunii in the subsample
# OPJ - number of juveniles infected with O. pajunii in the subsample
# OPM - number of males infected with O. pajunii in the subsample
# MBA - number of adults infected with M. bicuspidata in the subsample
# MBJ - number of juveniles infected with M. bicuspidata in the subsample
# MBM - number of males infected with M. bicuspidata in the subsample
# OPMBA - number of adults co-infected in the subsample
# OPMBJ - number of juveniles co-infected in the subsample
# OPMBM - number of males co-infected in the subsample
# algae - algae concentration in the pitcher, measured as Î¼g of chlorophyll a / L of water
